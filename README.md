# FizzBuzz
The FizzBuzz challenge goes something like this. Write a function that does the following:

    console logs the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the integer the function takes as its parameter
    logs fizz instead of the number for multiples of 3
    logs buzz instead of the number for multiples of 5
    logs fizzbuzz for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5

# Reasoning about the challenge
One important point about FizzBuzz relates to how you can find multiples of a number in JavaScript. You do this using the modulo or remainder operator, which looks like this: %. This operator returns the remainder after a division between two numbers. A remainder of 0 indicates that the first number is a multiple of the second number.
